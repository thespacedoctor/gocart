## Release Notes

**v0.4.4 - June 1, 2023**

- **FIXED**: fix in prob calculations in flattened maps
- **FIXED**: allowing symlinks in plugin folder

**v0.4.2 - May 28, 2023**

- **ENHANCEMENT**: added a `burst` filtering parameter. If set to True, burst event alerts will pass the filter, otherwise they filtered out (default).
- **REFACTOR**: maps with `CREATOR: ligo-skymap-from-samples` now named on file as `bilby.multiorder.fits`.
- **REFACTOR**: try, except added to listen parser. If an alert breaks the parser an ugly error message is reported, but the listener stays alive to listen to subsequent alerts.
- **FIXED**: burst events causing headaches for filtering and map conversion. The first 'real' burst event provided the necessary alert packet and map to create a realistic unit test for the entire codebase. The code is now much more robust to busrt event alerts.

**v0.4.1 - May 25, 2023**

- **FIXED**: a bug in filtering routine that caused alerts to pass the filtering algorithm if an unknown parameter in the filtering settings was found. It now fails by default instead of passing.

**0.4.0 - May 24, 2023**

- **FEATURE**: gocart can now run in daemon mode. Use the commands `gocart listen|quit|restart|status`   
- **ENHANCEMENT**: added an `event_dir_exist` parameter to the filtering criteria. If a previous event alert has passed the filtering criteria, it is now possible to allow all subsequent alerts will pass   
- **ENHANCEMENT**: redshift range added to the right side of aitoff plots  
- **REFACTOR**: removed `ligo.skymap` dependency as this is a huge package and was causing upgrades of gocart to take 20-40 mins. Required new code to convert multi-order skymaps to a single-order (I was previously relying on a function in `ligo.skymap` to do this)  

**v0.3.0 - May 18, 2023**  

- **FEATURE**: user can now add their own plugin scripts to run every time an alert is parsed  
- **ENHANCEMENT**: added a count of alerts read when first connected to kafka (gives users peace of mind that goacrt is working)  
- **FIXED**: area calulations fixed (I was still sort by prob but should have been sorting by probdensity for mulit-order maps)  
- **FIXED**: can still read an event ID even if not found in the sky-map header (tried to find the event ID from the map directory path)  

**v0.2.1 - April 26, 2023**  

- **FIXED**: listen command was tripping up on mock-events

**v0.2.0 - April 26, 2023**  

- **FEATURE**: filtering of alerts is now possible via options in the settings file (see docs)  
- **ENHANCEMENT**: option added to write the original json alert to file  
- **ENHANCEMENT**: gocart *should* be robust enough to handle burst events (tested against a hand crafted burst alert packet as none exist in the LVK Public Alert Guide yet).  

**v0.1.10 - April 21, 2023**  

- **REFACTOR**: splitting mockevents from superevents   

**v0.1.9 - April 19, 2023**  

- **REFACTOR**: sun and moon footprints replace terminator  

**v0.1.8 - April 6, 2023**  

- **FIXED**: echo command now parses message to the end of the partition queue  
- **FIXED**: listen command remembers where it left off  
- **FIXED**: sun & moon coordinates ... they were not geocentric!  

**v0.1.7 - April 4, 2023**  

- **FIXED**: unit test fix  

**v0.1.6 - April 4, 2023**  
 
- **ENHANCEMENT**: added localisation type to aitoff maps  
- **FIXED**: first time listen command no longer starteds from time zero but listens from first connection  
- **FIXED**: doc builds  

**v0.1.5 - April 4, 2023**  

- **FEATURE**: listen command added  
- **FEATURE**: echo command added  
- **FEATURE**: maps converted to ascii format  
- **FEATURE**: maps rendered as aitoff plots  
- **FEATURE**: meta.yaml file written with alert, FITS header and extra useful content  

**v0.1.4 - March 16, 2023**  

- fixing docsting test
